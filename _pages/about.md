üë®‚Äçüéì I'm a final year undergraduate student at the College Of Medicine, University Of Lagos.


üî¨ My research interests spans neuroimaging (Alzheimer's, Cancer prognostics & diagnostics) & domain-adaptive AI, with a focus on addressing diagnostic gaps in Sub-Saharan Africa & underserved populations(Low Resource Settings).

I'm also exploring applicable concepts like Multimodal learning, Vision transformers, GANs & Diffusion Models for Medical Image Processing & Analysis in my course of research.

üìö I'm currently working on Denoising Probabilistic Diffusion Models on Low-Res 3D MRI Datasets (BRATS23) sourced from African Diagnostic Institutions.

üë• I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.
